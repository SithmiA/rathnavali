        Volleyball is a team sport.
        The teams are separated by a large net.
        It has six players on each side of the net. 
        Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
        It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. 
        Beach Volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996.
