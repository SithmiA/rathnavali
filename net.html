        Netball is a sport played in two teams of seven. It is like basketball except that bouncing the ball is not allowed. 
        The player cannot step with the ball either, nor hold it for more than three seconds.
        Netball emerged from early versions of basketball and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. 
        Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States.
        The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.
