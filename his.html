        <h2><p>
            There was a significant Buddhist reawakening with the arrival of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott. Buddhist schools were established throughout
             the country to promote Buddhist education across with the prevailing missionary system. In 1881 there was a Buddhist reawakening as a 
             result of the start of the newspapers Sarasavi Sandaresa in 1880 and The Buddhist in 1881.After that, the expansion of school education
              came under the Buddhist Theosophical Society. Karunarathna laid the foundation stone for the school on 26 July 1945. After completing 
              the construction work of the buildings of Rathnavali Balika Vidyalaya, D. D. Karunaratne handed over the school to the Buddhist Theosophical Society.
            Rathnavali Balika Vidyalaya was opened on 17 December 1947 with 60 students, a staff consist of two teachers under the management
             of Mrs. Denagama who was the first principal of Rathnavali Balika Vidyalaya. On the same day, both primary and secondary education were started as the constructions of the two buildings were completed.
