        Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water.
        The sport takes place in pools or open water (in a sea or lake). 
        Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports.
        Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.
