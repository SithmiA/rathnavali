            Principal’s Message
            As the very proud Principal of this outstanding and academically discerning girls’
            Buddhist high school of Gampaha, Sri Lanka, with a well-respected history of providing 
            excellent educational outcomes for gifted and talented young women since 1947We support 
            the selected, fortunate young individuals in our school for their wellbeing by providing the 
            ideal atmosphere that allows every student to thrive as they work towards achieving their best 
            personal performance. Moreover, we set high expectations for our girls and work hard to safeguard 
            positive emotions across our school community, seeking to deepen their knowledge, provide enriching and 
            innovative learning experiences, while also softly urging our girls out of their comfort zone to attempt 
            new challenges of the globalized world. I am proud to mention that the school is blessed by an academic staff 
            of 3 deputy principals, and an assistant principal and teachers those who readily inspire the students to develop 
            creativity, confidence and resilience to become independent and ethical global citizens. We instill in our girls a 
            keen social conscience and the capacity to make ethical decisions while giving them the opportunities to achieve 
            excellence in academic , extra-curricular and sporting end eavours so that my staff and I, ever focus on encouraging 
            them to develop respectful relationships with their peers, teachers and without a debate, with the broader community too. 
            Good intentions and often valiant efforts of parents, teachers and other well wisher groups such as the School Development 
            Society and the Old Pupils’ Association have also been the precious contributors in our ascent
            towards success by encouraging and helping us more today, tomorrow and forever.
