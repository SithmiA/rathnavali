         Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players.
         It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish itfrom related games such as xiangqi. 
         The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar,
         much older games of Indian and Persian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games,
         played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. 
         Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
